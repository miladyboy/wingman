# Cursor Rule â€” Playwright in Monorepos

> **Scope:**  Applies to all Playwright E2E test runs in this monorepo.

## 1. Always Run Playwright from the `frontend` Directory
- Playwright must be executed from within the `frontend` directory to ensure correct config and dependency resolution.
- Do **not** use `--prefix` for Playwright. This flag is only for npm and does not affect Playwright's file/config resolution.

## 2. Use a Root-Level Shell Script for Automation
- For CI, Husky, or LLM automation, use a root-level shell script (e.g., `run-e2e.sh`) that:
  - Changes directory to `frontend`
  - Runs the Playwright test command

  Example `run-e2e.sh`:
  ```sh
  #!/bin/sh
  cd frontend && npx playwright test "$@"
  ```

## 3. Add a `test:e2e` Script to `frontend/package.json`
- For developer ergonomics, add:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "test:e2e": "playwright test"
  }
  ```
- This allows running E2E tests with `npm run test:e2e` from within `frontend`.

## 4. Exception to the General `--prefix` Rule
- This rule supersedes the general `--prefix` rule for Playwright only.
- All LLMs, CI, and developers must follow this pattern for Playwright E2E tests.
