# Wishlist

- [ ] Add Dark/Light theme.  
- [ ] Make session management optional through a "Remember Me" toggle.  
- [ ] Save memories based on what the bot sees in photos or what I say. (RAG) **(Hard)**

- [ ] Hacer un tear down de la DB que elimine todos los users de prueba?
- [ ] The UI should be reactive and update when you do things in other devices.
- [ ] Manage true test isolation for the E2E tests.
- [ ] Maybe I should create the user just after the email is verified. To prevent DB spam.
- [ ] Hacer mas solido el flow de confirmacion de emails. Para que puedan re-pedir el mail de confirmacion.

# Doing
- [ ] Improve prompting: The system prompt should consider three modes: Opening, Continuing conversation, or re-engaging.
- [ ] Add to the system prompt how it should treat when it receives multiple images at a time. It should treat them as a whole, as the user is asking for something together.
- [ ] Add to the system prompt how it should treat different pictures. There are three types, photos, conversations and metadata (Like tinder stats)
- [ ] Improve prompt engineering: better responses, shorter texts, and suggestions to naturally split long messages into 2–3 parts. *prompt*
- [ ] Perfect the prompting 100x
- [ ] Add so that the E2E suite runs on husky push.
