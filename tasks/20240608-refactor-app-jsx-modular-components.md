## Problem Statement
The main frontend application file, `frontend/src/App.jsx`, is currently monolithic (around 600 lines), making it difficult to navigate, maintain, and test. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle and can slow down development. Existing frontend components may also benefit from increased modularity and adherence to DRY principles.

## Outcome / Goal
`App.jsx` will be significantly reduced in size and complexity. Core UI sections and logic currently within `App.jsx` will be broken down into smaller, reusable, single-responsibility components. The frontend codebase will demonstrate improved adherence to DRY principles, better organization, and enhanced maintainability and scalability.

## User Story
As a developer, I want a more modular frontend codebase with smaller, well-defined components, so that it's easier to understand, maintain, test, and scale the application, leading to faster development cycles and fewer bugs.

## Acceptance Criteria
- `frontend/src/App.jsx` line count is significantly reduced (e.g., by at least 50%, or a quantifiable major reduction).
- Key logical sections of the current `App.jsx` (e.g., main layout structure, routing logic, primary views, complex UI segments) are extracted into their own dedicated components.
- New components are logically organized within the `frontend/src/components/` directory, potentially using subdirectories for features, UI elements, or pages.
- Each new and refactored component clearly demonstrates the Single Responsibility Principle.
- Duplicated JSX structures or JavaScript logic within `App.jsx` or across other components are minimized through the creation of shared/reusable components or custom hooks.
- All existing E2E tests (`frontend/tests/e2e/`) pass after the refactoring, or are updated appropriately to reflect the new component structure.
- New unit tests are added for any newly created, significant, and testable components or custom hooks.
- The application's overall functionality and user experience remain unchanged or are explicitly approved if minor changes are necessary for refactoring.

## Impact Analysis
- **Primary Files:**
    - `frontend/src/App.jsx` (will undergo major refactoring and reduction).
    - New component files will be created under `frontend/src/components/` (e.g., `frontend/src/components/layout/`, `frontend/src/components/chat/`, `frontend/src/components/ui/`, etc.).
    - Potentially new custom hook files under `frontend/src/hooks/`.
    - May involve creating or organizing components into page-specific directories if applicable (e.g., `frontend/src/pages/`).
- **Secondary Files:**
    - Routing configuration (`frontend/src/main.jsx` or wherever routes are defined) might need adjustments if route rendering logic is extracted from `App.jsx`.
    - Existing E2E tests in `frontend/tests/e2e/` will likely require updates to selectors and navigation paths due to changes in the DOM structure.
    - Unit tests for components that consume parts of `App.jsx`'s old logic might need updates.
- No backend changes are expected.
- No changes to environment variables are expected.

## Implementation Hints
- Start by identifying distinct logical sections within `App.jsx`. Examples:
    - Overall page layout (header, sidebar, main content area).
    - Chat interface components (message list, input area, conversation list).
    - Authentication-related views or wrappers.
    - Modal dialogs or global state managers if embedded directly.
- For each identified section, create a new React functional component.
- Organize new components into a clear directory structure (e.g., `components/layout`, `components/chat`, `components/common`, `components/features/[featureName]`).
- Utilize props effectively to pass data and callback functions to child components.
- Extract shared stateful logic or side effects into custom hooks (`frontend/src/hooks/`) to promote reusability and keep components lean.
- Review existing components under `frontend/src/components/` for opportunities to reuse them or refactor them further for better modularity.
- Ensure new components are well-documented with JSDoc-style comments, explaining their purpose, props, and usage.
- Focus on readability, maintainability, and testability throughout the refactoring process.
- Perform changes incrementally and test frequently.

## Testing Requirements
- **Unit Tests:**
    - Write new unit tests for any significant, newly created components (especially those with internal logic, state management, or complex rendering).
    - Write unit tests for any new custom hooks.
    - Ensure existing relevant unit tests are updated and continue to pass.
- **Integration Tests:**
    - (If applicable with current testing setup) Verify that the refactored `App.jsx` correctly integrates and communicates with its new child components.
- **E2E Tests:**
    - All existing E2E tests in `frontend/tests/e2e/` must pass.
    - Update selectors, assertions, and navigation steps in E2E tests as necessary to align with the new DOM structure resulting from component refactoring.

## Out-of-Scope
- Major changes to the application's existing features or core business logic. The primary goal is structural improvement.
- A complete redesign of the UI/UX. Minor visual adjustments for the sake of component separation are acceptable if unavoidable.
- Introducing new global state management libraries if not already in use, unless absolutely necessary and agreed upon for the refactor.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk:** Introducing regressions or breaking existing functionality during a large-scale refactor.
  **Mitigation:**
    - Work incrementally, refactoring one section or group of components at a time.
    - Commit changes frequently with clear messages.
    - Run E2E and unit tests often throughout the process.
    - Consider feature flags or branching strategies if the refactor is extensive and needs to be merged in stages.
- **Risk:** Over-engineering by creating too many small, granular components, leading to prop-drilling or difficult-to-trace logic.
  **Mitigation:**
    - Strive for a balance: components should be small enough to be manageable and have a single responsibility, but not so small that they obscure the overall architecture.
    - Utilize React Context or other state management solutions appropriately for global or deeply nested state to avoid excessive prop-drilling.
- **Risk:** E2E tests becoming very brittle or hard to update.
  **Mitigation:**
    - Ensure stable `data-testid` attributes are used for key elements targeted by E2E tests.
    - Update E2E tests in parallel with component refactoring.
