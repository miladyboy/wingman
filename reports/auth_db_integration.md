# Supabase Authentication and Database Integration Report

## Date: April 8, 2024

## Objective
Integrate robust user authentication and database persistence into the application using Supabase, replacing the previous `localStorage`-based approach for storing conversation data.

## Progress Summary

Significant progress has been made in implementing Supabase for both authentication and database management:

1.  **Supabase Project Setup:**
    *   A new Supabase project named "rizzle" (`fsfcxzwlzqejrazcwsym`) was successfully created.
    *   API URL and Anon Key were retrieved and configured.

2.  **Database Schema & RLS:**
    *   A database schema was defined and applied via migration, including:
        *   `profiles` table (linked to `auth.users`, stores username, email).
        *   `conversations` table (owned by users, includes title, timestamps).
        *   `messages` table (linked to conversations, stores sender, content, image description).
    *   Row Level Security (RLS) policies were configured for all tables to ensure users can only access and modify their own data.
    *   A trigger (`handle_new_user`) was implemented to automatically create a user profile upon sign-up.

3.  **Frontend Implementation (`/frontend`):
    *   **Supabase Client:** The `@supabase/supabase-js` library was installed, and a client (`supabaseClient.js`) was configured using environment variables (`VITE_...`).
    *   **Authentication UI:** An `Auth.jsx` component was created to handle user registration (with username) and login via email/password.
    *   **Core Application (`App.jsx`):**
        *   Refactored significantly to manage Supabase session state (`onAuthStateChange`).
        *   Replaced all `localStorage` logic for loading/saving threads with direct Supabase database operations for `conversations` and `messages` tables.
        *   Fetches user-specific conversations and messages upon login.
        *   Handles creation and renaming of conversations via database calls.
        *   Passes the Supabase `access_token` in the `Authorization` header when calling the backend `/analyze` endpoint.
    *   **Component Updates:** `Sidebar.jsx` updated to display user info and handle logout; `ChatHistory.jsx` updated to render messages from the new database structure.
    *   **Environment Variables:** Configured in `.env` using the `VITE_` prefix required by Create React App.

4.  **Backend Implementation (`/backend`):
    *   **Supabase Client:** The `@supabase/supabase-js` library was installed.
    *   **`/analyze` Endpoint:** Updated to receive the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header from the frontend. While the endpoint currently doesn't perform user-specific database actions itself, it acknowledges the token.
    *   **Environment Variables:** Configured in `.env` for `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` (placeholder added for the sensitive key).

5.  **Troubleshooting:** Addressed initial file creation issues and corrected environment variable handling syntax for the frontend build system (Vite vs. CRA).

## Next Steps

*   Manual insertion of the `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` into `backend/.env`.
*   Thorough testing of the complete authentication flow (register, login, logout) and all chat functionalities (new chat, sending text/images, renaming) to ensure data persistence and RLS policies are working correctly.
*   Backend review: Ensure the OpenAI API key is correctly configured and the backend server runs without issues.
*   Consider implementing Supabase Realtime features for live chat updates (optional enhancement).
