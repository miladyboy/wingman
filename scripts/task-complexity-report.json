      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down this TypeScript migration task into specific subtasks covering: 1) Inventory and analysis of existing .txt files, 2) TypeScript template creation with type safety, 3) Configuration updates for the taskmaster MCP framework, 4) Codebase reference updates, and 5) Testing and validation of the migration.",
      "reasoning": "Medium complexity due to file system operations, TypeScript type safety implementation, and framework integration. Requires careful handling of template variables and maintaining backward compatibility during migration."

      "expansionPrompt": "Decompose this E2E test implementation into subtasks: 1) Test environment setup and image preparation, 2) Playwright file upload implementation, 3) AI response capture and analysis, 4) Content verification assertion logic, 5) Error handling and edge cases, and 6) Cross-browser compatibility testing.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to file upload mechanics, AI response timing variability, content analysis validation, and cross-browser compatibility requirements. Requires robust error handling and flexible assertion logic."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break this typing indicator test into subtasks: 1) Test setup and chat interface navigation, 2) Typing indicator detection and timing validation, 3) AI response synchronization and indicator disappearance, and 4) Cross-browser testing and performance validation.",
      "reasoning": "Moderate complexity involving timing-sensitive UI state verification and animation testing. Requires careful handling of race conditions and cross-browser compatibility for animations."

      "expansionPrompt": "Divide this optimistic UI implementation into subtasks: 1) Frontend chat service optimistic deletion patterns, 2) UI component immediate updates and animations, 3) Error handling and rollback mechanisms, 4) State management updates for pending operations, 5) Backend integration and API error handling, 6) Comprehensive testing strategy, and 7) Performance optimization and edge case handling.",
      "reasoning": "High complexity due to optimistic UI patterns, complex state management, error recovery mechanisms, and the need to maintain consistency between UI and backend states. Requires sophisticated error handling and rollback logic."

      "expansionPrompt": "Break down this comprehensive API migration into subtasks: 1) Package installation and dependency setup, 2) Environment variable migration and configuration, 3) Direct API call identification and mapping, 4) Core API refactoring to ai-sdk patterns, 5) Feature-specific updates (chat, streaming, tools), 6) Code cleanup and removal of obsolete code, 7) Testing updates and validation, and 8) Documentation and deployment updates.",
      "reasoning": "Very high complexity due to comprehensive codebase changes affecting multiple systems (frontend, backend, streaming, error handling). High risk of breaking existing functionality and requires extensive testing across all LLM-powered features."
