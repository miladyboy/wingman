# Description:
After every code or test file change, the AI must:
- Check for unused imports, variables, functions, or classes.
- Remove any unused code unless it is required for future planned work (and document this).
- Prefer to run a linter (e.g., eslint, ts-unused-exports, etc.) if available, and act on its findings.
- Report all removals in the “What I just tweaked” section.
