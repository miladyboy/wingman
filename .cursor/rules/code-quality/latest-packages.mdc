# Cursor Rule — Smart Dependency Installation

1. **New dependency**  
   - Add with `npm install <pkg>@latest --save` **only if** it’s a fresh dependency.  
   - Immediately run the tests; if any break, pin to the latest *compatible* major (`npm install <pkg>@x.y.z --save`).

2. **Existing dependency upgrades**  
   - Do **not** auto-upgrade to `@latest` during regular edits.  
   - Instead trigger a manual upgrade routine (`npx npm-check-updates -u && npm install`) in a dedicated PR so CI can vet changes.

3. **Lockfiles are sacred**  
   - Always commit the lockfile (`package-lock.json`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, etc.) so builds stay deterministic across machines.

4. **Report**  
   - Call out any new or upgraded packages (and their versions) in the “What I just tweaked” summary.

> **Rule of thumb:** never let unreviewed major bumps slip into `main`.
