# Test Integrity Rule:
You must not modify, weaken, or remove existing test code solely to make failing tests pass.

Test changes are only allowed if:
They are required by a legitimate change in application requirements or implementation, and the change is clearly explained and justified in the commit message or pull request description.

All test code changes must be reviewed with extra scrutiny to ensure they are not simply “making the code green” without real justification.
