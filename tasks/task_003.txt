# Task ID: 3
# Title: E2E Test: Verify AI Reply Generation After User Message
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create an end-to-end test that verifies AI-generated replies appear in the chat after a user sends a message, ensuring core product functionality works correctly. The test implementation has been completed and is successfully detecting that AI responses are not currently working in the test environment.
# Details:
This task involves implementing a comprehensive E2E test to verify the AI response functionality:

**COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION:**
- ✅ Created `frontend/tests/e2e/ai-reply.spec.ts` with comprehensive test suite
- ✅ Implemented 3 test scenarios: basic AI reply, message ordering, and multi-turn conversations
- ✅ Uses correct selectors: `[data-testid="chat-message"][data-sender="bot"]` for AI messages
- ✅ Robust timeout handling (60 seconds) and proper error messaging
- ✅ Debug logging to identify message structure and flow
- ✅ Test correctly fails when AI doesn't respond, indicating backend/AI service issues

**CURRENT STATUS:**
The test is working correctly but reveals that the AI backend is not responding to messages in the test environment. The test successfully:
- Sends user messages through the chat interface
- Waits appropriately for AI responses with proper timeout handling
- Correctly identifies when AI responses are missing
- Provides detailed debug output showing only user messages appear

**REMAINING WORK:**
1. **Backend Investigation:** Determine why AI service is not responding to chat messages
2. **Service Integration:** Ensure AI backend is properly connected and functional in test environment
3. **Test Validation:** Once AI is working, verify all test scenarios pass correctly
4. **Error Handling Enhancement:** Consider adding test variant for graceful AI unavailability handling

# Test Strategy:
**COMPLETED TEST IMPLEMENTATION:**
- ✅ Test file created with 3 comprehensive scenarios
- ✅ Proper selector usage and message differentiation
- ✅ Timeout and error handling implemented
- ✅ Debug logging for troubleshooting

**CURRENT VALIDATION STATUS:**
1. **Test Functionality Verified:**
   - Test correctly identifies missing AI responses
   - Proper failure modes when AI doesn't respond
   - Debug output confirms test logic is sound

2. **Backend Issue Identified:**
   - AI service not responding to user messages
   - Test environment may lack proper AI backend configuration
   - Need to investigate AI service connectivity and setup

3. **Next Validation Steps:**
   - Fix AI backend connectivity issues
   - Run tests once AI service is functional
   - Verify all 3 test scenarios pass with working AI
   - Validate test stability across multiple runs

4. **Integration Testing:**
   - Ensure test works in CI/CD pipeline once AI is fixed
   - Verify compatibility with other E2E tests
   - Test in different environments (dev, staging)

5. **Monitoring Setup:**
   - Use test as AI service health check
   - Set up alerts for AI response failures
   - Document AI service dependencies

# Subtasks:
## 3.1. Investigate AI Backend Service Connectivity [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Determine why the AI service is not responding to chat messages in the test environment
### Details:
The E2E test is correctly implemented but reveals that AI responses are not being generated. Need to investigate:
- AI service configuration in test environment
- Backend API connectivity between chat and AI service
- Authentication or API key issues
- Service availability and health status

## 3.2. Validate Test Suite Once AI Service is Functional [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Run the completed E2E test suite to ensure all scenarios pass when AI backend is working
### Details:
Once AI service issues are resolved:
- Execute all 3 test scenarios (basic reply, message ordering, multi-turn)
- Verify proper AI response detection and validation
- Confirm test stability and timing
- Validate in multiple browser environments

## 3.3. Add AI Service Unavailability Test Scenario [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create additional test to verify graceful handling when AI service is intentionally unavailable
### Details:
Implement test scenario that:
- Simulates AI service downtime or unavailability
- Verifies appropriate user feedback (loading states, error messages)
- Ensures chat interface remains functional for user messages
- Tests timeout behavior and error recovery
