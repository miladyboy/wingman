# Task ID: 6
# Title: E2E Test: Image Upload and AI Analysis Verification
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: high
# Description: Create an end-to-end test that uploads an image to the chat interface and verifies that the AI's response contains relevant content analysis of the uploaded image.
# Details:
This task involves implementing a comprehensive E2E test to verify image upload and AI analysis functionality:

1. **Test Setup:**
   - Create a new Playwright test file `image-analysis.spec.ts` in the E2E test suite
   - Prepare test image files (various formats: JPG, PNG, WebP) with known content for verification
   - Set up test authentication and navigate to the chat interface
   - Ensure clean state with no existing conversation history

2. **Image Upload Implementation:**
   - Locate and interact with the image upload component/button in the chat interface
   - Use Playwright's file upload capabilities to select and upload test images
   - Wait for upload completion indicators (progress bars, success states)
   - Verify the image appears in the chat interface as an uploaded message

3. **AI Response Verification:**
   - Wait for AI response generation after image upload (with appropriate timeout)
   - Capture the AI's response text content
   - Implement content analysis assertions that verify the response references the image:
     - Check for image-related keywords (e.g., "image", "picture", "photo", "shows", "contains")
     - Verify response mentions specific content visible in the test image
     - Ensure response length indicates substantive analysis (not generic error messages)

4. **Error Handling and Edge Cases:**
   - Test with different image formats and sizes
   - Verify proper error handling for unsupported file types
   - Test timeout scenarios if AI doesn't respond within expected timeframe
   - Validate that the test fails appropriately when AI response is irrelevant or missing

5. **Test Data Management:**
   - Create a set of test images with known, verifiable content
   - Document expected AI response patterns for each test image
   - Implement flexible assertion logic that can adapt to various valid AI responses

# Test Strategy:
1. **Functional Verification:**
   - Run the test with multiple test images and verify AI responses contain image-specific content
   - Manually upload the same test images and compare AI responses to ensure test accuracy
   - Verify test fails when AI response is generic or doesn't reference the image

2. **Cross-Browser Testing:**
   - Execute the test across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to ensure file upload compatibility
   - Test on different viewport sizes to verify responsive image upload functionality

3. **Performance Testing:**
   - Measure and validate image upload and AI response times are within acceptable limits
   - Test with various image file sizes to ensure consistent behavior

4. **Regression Testing:**
   - Include this test in the CI/CD pipeline to catch regressions in image analysis functionality
   - Run test against different AI model versions to ensure consistent image analysis capabilities

5. **Error Scenario Validation:**
   - Intentionally test with corrupted or invalid image files to verify proper error handling
   - Test network interruption scenarios during image upload
   - Verify test correctly identifies when AI responses are inadequate or missing image references
