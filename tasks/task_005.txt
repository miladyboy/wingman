# Task ID: 5
# Title: E2E Test: Cancel Subscription Flow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create an end-to-end test that validates the complete subscription cancellation flow, verifying that users lose access to pro features and their subscription state is properly updated after cancellation.
# Details:
This task involves implementing a comprehensive E2E test for the subscription cancellation flow:

1. **Test Setup:**
   - Create a new Playwright test file `cancel-subscription.spec.ts` in the E2E test suite
   - Set up test data with a pre-existing subscribed user account
   - Implement authentication flow to log in as the subscribed user
   - Navigate to the subscription management interface

2. **Subscription Cancellation Flow:**
   - Locate and interact with the subscription cancellation UI elements
   - Handle any confirmation dialogs or multi-step cancellation process
   - Verify cancellation confirmation messages or success indicators
   - Capture any redirect behavior after cancellation completion

3. **Access Control Verification:**
   - Attempt to access pro features that should now be restricted
   - Verify appropriate error messages or access denied responses
   - Test navigation to premium sections and confirm lockout behavior
   - Validate UI changes that indicate downgraded access level

4. **Subscription State Validation:**
   - Check user profile or account settings to confirm subscription status change
   - Verify database state changes if accessible through API endpoints
   - Confirm billing status updates and cancellation timestamps
   - Test that subscription benefits are immediately revoked

5. **Error Handling:**
   - Implement robust waiting strategies for async operations
   - Handle potential network delays during cancellation processing
   - Add retry logic for flaky subscription service interactions
   - Ensure test fails appropriately if access is not properly revoked

6. **Test Data Management:**
   - Create reusable test utilities for subscription setup and teardown
   - Implement cleanup procedures to reset test user state
   - Consider using test-specific subscription tiers for isolation

# Test Strategy:
1. **Pre-test Verification:** Confirm the test user has an active subscription and can access pro features before starting the cancellation flow.

2. **Cancellation Process Testing:** Execute the complete cancellation flow through the UI, verifying each step completes successfully and any confirmation messages appear.

3. **Immediate Access Verification:** Immediately after cancellation, attempt to access multiple pro features and verify they are properly restricted with appropriate error messages.

4. **Subscription Status Validation:** Check the user's account settings, profile, or subscription management page to confirm the subscription status shows as cancelled or downgraded.

5. **Persistent Access Control:** Log out and log back in to ensure access restrictions persist across sessions and are not just temporary UI changes.

6. **API State Verification:** If available, make API calls to verify the user's subscription state in the backend matches the expected cancelled status.

7. **Negative Testing:** Verify the test fails appropriately by temporarily commenting out access control logic and confirming the test catches the failure.

8. **Cross-browser Testing:** Run the test across different browsers to ensure cancellation flow works consistently across platforms.

9. **Performance Validation:** Ensure cancellation processing completes within reasonable time limits and doesn't cause timeouts or hanging states.
