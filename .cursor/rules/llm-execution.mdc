# LLM Execution Rulebook

## 1. Autonomous Iteration

Keep iterating and debugging **autonomously** until the task is completely solved end-to-end.  
- **Never** pause to request confirmation or exit early.  
- If database work is required, proactively use the appropriate tools—e.g. **Supabase MCP**—without waiting for further instructions.

---

## 2. Clarification Before Execution

If **anything** is unclear, ask as many clarifying questions as needed **before** starting; do not proceed until you are 100 % certain of the requirements.

---

## 3. Proactive Dependency Installation

Whenever you introduce a new dependency:  
1. **Immediately install** it with the correct package-manager command (`npm install <package>`, `pip install <package>`, etc.).  
2. Verify the installation succeeds **before** moving on.

---

## 4. Debugging Protocol

1. List the **4–5 most plausible root-cause hypotheses** in order of likelihood.  
2. Focus initial effort on the **top two** hypotheses.  
3. Instrument the code with clear, descriptive `console.log` (or equivalent) statements at key checkpoints to expose state and control flow.  
4. Keep iterating—re-run, observe, and adjust—until the error is definitively fixed.  
5. Only after verifying the fix, **remove the temporary logging** and finalize the solution.

## 5. Development Server Management

> **Absolute rule:** **Never `cd` into sub-directories to launch a server.**  
> Always launch servers from the repo root with `npm run dev --prefix <dir>`.

### 5.1 Front-End (port 3001)

| Step | Command / Action | Notes |
|------|------------------|-------|
| **Start** | `npm run dev --prefix frontend` | **Do not `cd` into `frontend/`; use `--prefix`.** |
| **Check existing instance** | `lsof -i :3001` | If the listed process belongs to the current project, keep using it. |
| **Kill stale process** | `kill -9 <PID>` | Only if the port 3001 process is unrelated or frozen. |
| **Re-launch** | Re-run the start command **after** ensuring port 3001 is free. |

### 5.2 Back-End (port 8081)

| Step | Command / Action | Notes |
|------|------------------|-------|
| **Start** | `npm run dev --prefix backend` | **Do not `cd` into `backend/`; use `--prefix`.** |
| **Check existing instance** | `lsof -i :8081` | If the listed process belongs to the current project, keep using it. |
| **Kill stale process** | `kill -9 <PID>` | Only if the port 8081 process is unrelated or frozen. |
| **Re-launch** | Re-run the start command **after** ensuring port 8081 is free. |
