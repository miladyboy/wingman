- **Always verify the existence of `data-testid` attributes in the codebase before referencing them in Playwright or other E2E/UI tests.**

  - Search the relevant component(s) for the expected `data-testid` before writing or running a test that uses it.

  - If the attribute does not exist but is required for test stability, add it optimistically to the component(s) in a minimal, non-breaking way.
  - Prefer adding `data-testid` to form fields, buttons, and other interactive elements that are targeted by tests.
- **Report all such additions or changes in the update summary** ("What I just tweaked") so reviewers are aware of new or modified test IDs.
- **Rationale:**
  - Prevents test flakiness and wasted debugging time due to missing selectors.
  - Ensures a stable contract between UI code and automated tests.
- **Examples:**
  ```jsx
  // ✅ DO: Add data-testid if missing
  <Input id="email" data-testid="register-email" ... />
  <Button type="submit" data-testid="register-submit">Register</Button>
  ```
  ```typescript
  // ✅ DO: Only use selectors that exist in the codebase
  await page.fill('[data-testid="register-email"]', email);
  ```
