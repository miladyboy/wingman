# Title: E2E Test: Cookie Consent Banner Verification
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create an end-to-end test that verifies the cookie consent banner appears on first visit, can be dismissed, and remains hidden on subsequent visits for legal compliance.
# Details:
This task involves implementing a comprehensive E2E test to verify cookie consent banner functionality:

1. **Test Setup:**
   - Create a new Playwright test file `cookie-banner.spec.ts` in the E2E test suite
   - Configure test to start with a clean browser context (no existing cookies)
   - Set up page navigation utilities and banner element selectors

2. **First Visit Test Implementation:**
   - Clear all cookies and local storage before test execution
   - Navigate to the application homepage
   - Verify that the cookie consent banner is visible and contains expected text
   - Check that banner has proper accessibility attributes (ARIA labels, role)
   - Verify banner positioning and styling meet design requirements

3. **Banner Interaction Testing:**
   - Test banner dismiss functionality (accept/decline buttons)
   - Verify that clicking dismiss button hides the banner immediately
   - Check that appropriate cookies are set after banner interaction
   - Test keyboard navigation and accessibility compliance

4. **Persistence Verification:**
   - After dismissing banner, reload the page and verify banner does not reappear
   - Navigate to different pages within the application to ensure banner stays hidden
   - Test that banner reappears after clearing cookies manually
   - Verify banner behavior across different browser sessions

5. **Edge Cases and Error Handling:**
   - Test banner behavior with JavaScript disabled
   - Verify banner appears correctly on different viewport sizes
   - Test banner functionality with ad blockers or privacy extensions
   - Ensure banner doesn't interfere with other page functionality

6. **Cross-Browser Compatibility:**
   - Run tests across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
   - Verify consistent behavior across desktop and mobile viewports
   - Test with different cookie settings and privacy modes

# Test Strategy:
1. **Pre-test Verification:**
   - Confirm test environment has cookie banner implementation deployed
   - Verify test can successfully clear browser state between runs
   - Check that banner selectors are stable and reliable

2. **Functional Testing:**
   - Run test with fresh browser context and verify banner appears within 3 seconds
   - Test banner dismiss functionality and confirm immediate hiding
   - Verify cookie persistence by checking browser storage after dismissal
   - Reload page multiple times and confirm banner remains hidden

3. **Regression Testing:**
   - Run test suite after any frontend changes to ensure banner still works
   - Test banner behavior alongside other E2E tests to check for conflicts
   - Verify banner doesn't break existing user flows or navigation

4. **Performance Validation:**
   - Measure banner load time and ensure it doesn't delay page rendering
   - Check that banner scripts don't impact Core Web Vitals metrics
   - Verify banner dismissal is responsive and doesn't cause layout shifts

5. **Accessibility Compliance:**
   - Use automated accessibility testing tools to verify banner compliance
   - Test banner with screen readers and keyboard-only navigation
   - Verify proper focus management when banner appears and disappears

6. **Cross-Environment Testing:**
   - Run tests in staging and production environments
   - Test with different user agents and browser configurations
   - Verify banner works correctly with CDN and caching layers
