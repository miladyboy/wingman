# Task ID: 2
# Title: Remove Nickname Field from Registration Flow
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Remove the 'username' field from the user registration flow, update all related tests, and create a Supabase migration to drop the username column from the database table.
# Details:
This task involves completely removing the username functionality from the registration system:

1. **Frontend Changes:**
   - Remove username input field from registration forms/components
   - Update form validation schemas to exclude username validation
   - Remove username-related state management and form handlers
   - Update TypeScript interfaces/types to remove username property
   - Remove any username display logic in user profiles or components

2. **Backend Changes:**
   - Update API endpoints to not accept username in registration requests
   - Remove username from user creation/update logic
   - Update request validation schemas to exclude username
   - Remove username from any user serialization/response objects

3. **Database Migration:**
   - Create a Supabase migration file to drop the username column
   - Ensure proper rollback strategy in case migration needs to be reverted
   - Update any database constraints or indexes that reference the username column
   - Consider data backup if username data needs to be preserved

4. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Update API documentation to reflect removed username field
   - Update any user guides or registration flow documentation

5. **Code Cleanup:**
   - Remove any utility functions specifically for username handling
   - Clean up imports and dependencies related to username functionality
   - Remove all references to username in test files and test data

# Test Strategy:
Verification should include:

1. **Frontend Testing:**
   - Verify registration forms no longer display username input field
   - Test form submission works without username data
   - Confirm TypeScript compilation passes without username-related type errors
   - Test user profile displays correctly without username references

2. **Backend Testing:**
   - Test registration API endpoints reject requests containing username field
   - Verify user creation works without username parameter
   - Confirm API responses don't include username field
   - Test that existing users without username data function normally

3. **Database Testing:**
   - Run the migration in a test environment to ensure it executes successfully
   - Verify the username column is completely removed from the user table
   - Test that existing user records remain intact after column removal
   - Confirm application functionality works with updated database schema

4. **Integration Testing:**
   - End-to-end test of complete registration flow without username
   - Test user login and profile access for both new and existing users
   - Verify no broken references to username field throughout the application

5. **Test File Updates:**
   - Remove all username references from test files
   - Update test data and fixtures to exclude username field
   - Verify all tests pass after username field removal

6. **Rollback Testing:**
   - Test migration rollback functionality in development environment
   - Ensure application can handle both old and new schema during deployment
