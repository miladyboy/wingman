For each prompt file:\n   - Create a corresponding .ts file in the same directory structure\n   - Convert the plain text content to a TypeScript template string format\n   - Add appropriate type annotations and exports\n   - Implement any necessary template variable interpolation\n\nExample conversion:\n```\n// Before: prompt.txt\nThis is a prompt with a {{variable}}\n\n// After: prompt.ts\nexport const promptTemplate = (params: {variable: string}): string => {\n  return `This is a prompt with a ${params.variable}`;\n};\n```\n\n3. Update the taskmaster MCP configuration to use the new TypeScript template files instead of the .txt files\n4. Ensure all imports/requires in the codebase are updated to reference the new .ts files\n5. Implement error handling for template variable validation\n6. Add documentation comments to each template file explaining its purpose and required parameters\n\nThis migration will improve code maintainability by providing type safety for prompt templates and enabling better IDE support for template editing.",

      "priority": "medium",
      "details": "This task involves debugging and fixing the existing cookie consent E2E test in `frontend/tests/e2e/cookieConsent.spec.js`. **Root cause analysis complete:** Test is failing at `page.waitForFunction(() => window.posthog !== undefined)` because PostHog environment variables are not configured in the test environment.\n\n1. **Environment Configuration (Priority Fix):**\n   - Verify and configure PostHog environment variables (VITE_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_KEY, VITE_PUBLIC_POSTHOG_HOST) for test environment\n   - Add fallback configuration for test scenarios where PostHog should not initialize\n   - Document environment setup requirements for E2E tests\n   - Create test-specific environment configuration that handles analytics gracefully\n\n2. **PostHog Integration Handling:**\n   - Add conditional logic to handle cases where PostHog is not available or fails to initialize\n   - Implement proper timeout handling for PostHog initialization waits\n   - Add mock/stub options for PostHog in test environment to avoid external dependencies\n   - Create test utilities for analytics state verification that work with or without PostHog\n\n3. **Test Logic Improvements:**\n   - Replace hard PostHog dependency with more flexible analytics detection\n   - Add proper error handling for analytics initialization failures\n   - Implement retry mechanisms for flaky interactions\n   - Improve test isolation by clearing cookies/localStorage between test runs\n   - Add explicit waits with reasonable timeouts and fallback strategies\n\n4. **Selector Updates:**\n   - Inspect the current cookie consent banner implementation to identify correct selectors\n   - Update test selectors to use more stable attributes (data-testid, role, aria-label)\n   - Replace fragile CSS selectors with robust element identification strategies\n   - Ensure selectors work across different viewport sizes and browser states\n\n5. **Banner Visibility Verification:**\n   - Fix assertions for banner appearance on first visit\n   - Ensure proper verification of banner positioning and content\n   - Add checks for banner accessibility attributes and ARIA compliance\n   - Verify banner behavior across different screen sizes\n\n6. **Accept/Refuse Action Testing:**\n   - Fix click handlers for accept and refuse buttons\n   - Verify proper cookie setting after each action\n   - Test that banner dismisses correctly after user interaction\n   - Ensure proper state persistence across page reloads\n\n7. **Analytics Integration Testing (Robust Approach):**\n   - Create environment-aware analytics verification that works with or without PostHog\n   - Test that analytics behavior is appropriate for the test environment\n   - Add checks for analytics configuration based on consent state\n   - Implement fallback verification methods when PostHog is not available\n\n8. **CI Stability Improvements:**\n   - Add browser-specific configurations for consistent behavior\n   - Implement proper test timeouts and retry strategies\n   - Add debugging artifacts (screenshots, videos) for CI failures\n   - Ensure test works reliably across different CI environments\n   - Document environment variable requirements for CI setup",
      "testStrategy": "1. **Environment Setup Verification:**\n   - Test with PostHog environment variables both set and unset to ensure robustness\n   - Verify test behavior in different environment configurations (dev, staging, CI)\n   - Document and validate required environment setup for consistent test execution\n   - Create test scenarios that work regardless of PostHog availability\n\n2. **Local Testing Verification:**\n   - Run the fixed test locally 10+ times with different environment configurations\n   - Test across different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari) to verify cross-browser compatibility\n   - Verify test passes with different network conditions (slow 3G, fast connection)\n   - Test with browser developer tools open to simulate debugging scenarios\n   - Test both with and without PostHog environment variables configured\n\n3. **CI Pipeline Validation:**\n   - Run test in CI environment multiple times to confirm stability\n   - Monitor test execution time to ensure it completes within reasonable timeouts\n   - Verify test artifacts (screenshots, videos) are properly captured on failures\n   - Check test passes consistently across different CI runner configurations\n   - Validate that CI environment has proper PostHog configuration or graceful fallbacks\n\n4. **Functional Verification:**\n   - Manually verify each test scenario matches actual user behavior\n   - Test banner appearance on genuinely first visits (incognito mode)\n   - Verify accept/refuse actions work as expected in real browser sessions\n   - Confirm analytics behavior is appropriate for the test environment\n   - Test graceful degradation when analytics services are unavailable\n\n5. **Edge Case Testing:**\n   - Test with ad blockers enabled to ensure test doesn't break\n   - Verify behavior with JavaScript disabled/enabled scenarios\n   - Test with different viewport sizes and mobile device emulation\n   - Check behavior when cookies are disabled in browser settings\n   - Test scenarios where PostHog fails to load or initialize\n\n6. **Performance Impact Assessment:**\n   - Measure test execution time before and after fixes\n   - Ensure test doesn't significantly slow down the overall E2E test suite\n   - Verify test cleanup doesn't leave behind state that affects other tests\n   - Confirm timeout improvements reduce overall test flakiness",

      "details": "This task involves extracting image rendering logic from ChatImages into a dedicated, reusable component:\n\n1. **Create ChatImage Component:**\n   - Create `components/chat/ChatImage.tsx` with proper TypeScript interfaces\n   - Define props interface including: `src`, `alt`, `onLoad`, `onError`, `className`, `loading` state\n   - Implement image rendering with proper error boundaries and loading states\n   - Add fallback UI for failed image loads (broken image icon, retry button)\n   - Include proper accessibility attributes (alt text, ARIA labels)\n   - Implement responsive styling with CSS modules or styled-components\n\n2. **Component Features:**\n   - Lazy loading support with intersection observer\n   - Image optimization (WebP support, size constraints)\n   - Error state management with retry functionality\n   - Loading skeleton/placeholder while image loads\n   - Click-to-expand functionality for larger viewing\n   - Proper image caching and performance optimization\n\n3. **Update ChatImages Component:**\n   - Refactor ChatImages to map over image array using ChatImage component\n   - Remove inline image rendering logic and styling\n   - Pass appropriate props to each ChatImage instance\n   - Maintain existing functionality while using the new component\n   - Update any image-related state management to work with the new structure\n\n4. **TypeScript Integration:**\n   - Define comprehensive prop interfaces with proper typing\n   - Add JSDoc comments for all public methods and props\n   - Ensure strict type checking with no `any` types\n   - Export proper types for consumers of the component\n\n5. **Documentation:**\n   - Create comprehensive Storybook stories showing all component states\n   - Add README.md with usage examples and API documentation\n   - Include prop table with descriptions and default values\n   - Document accessibility features and best practices",
