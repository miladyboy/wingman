# Project Progress Report

## Project Overview
The project is a React application designed to generate flirty response suggestions based on user input, which can be either text, images, or both. The application leverages OpenAI's API to process the input and return suggestions.

## Key Features Implemented
1. **Multi-Input Handling**: The application supports three types of user input:
   - Image only
   - Image with text
   - Text only

2. **Backend Enhancements**:
   - Updated the `/analyze` endpoint in `backend/server.js` to handle different input types.
   - Implemented logic to process uploaded images and create appropriate API payloads.
   - Added error handling to manage API response errors effectively.

3. **Frontend Enhancements**:
   - Updated `frontend/src/components/UploadComponent.jsx` to include a text input field.
   - Implemented functionality to handle multiple input cases, allowing users to enter text, upload images, and submit both.
   - Enhanced `frontend/src/App.jsx` to manage new functionality, including state management for loading and error handling.
   - Improved `SuggestionsComponent` to enhance appearance and functionality, including the ability to copy suggestions to the clipboard.

4. **GitHub Repository**:
   - Created a new repository named "flirt-ai-wingman".
   - Added all necessary backend and frontend files to the repository.
   - Included configuration files for Vite, Tailwind CSS, and the main React components.
   - Provided a detailed README with installation and usage instructions.

## Repository Details
- **Repository Name**: wingman
- **Repository Link**: [GitHub Repository](#) https://github.com/miladya
1. **Core Feature**: Multi-step conversation. The user should be able to keep talking to the AI to refine the advice, or even send future pictures of the same girl and get new advice.  

This report should provide a comprehensive overview for the next developer to continue building and enhancing the application. If there are any specific areas that need further clarification or focus, please let me know!
