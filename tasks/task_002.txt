# Task ID: 2
# Title: Remove Nickname Field from Registration Flow
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Remove the 'nickname' field from the user registration flow, update all related tests, and create a Supabase migration to drop the nickname column from the database table.
# Details:
This task involves completely removing the nickname functionality from the registration system:

1. **Frontend Changes:**
   - Remove nickname input field from registration forms/components
   - Update form validation schemas to exclude nickname validation
   - Remove nickname-related state management and form handlers
   - Update TypeScript interfaces/types to remove nickname property
   - Remove any nickname display logic in user profiles or components

2. **Backend Changes:**
   - Update API endpoints to not accept nickname in registration requests
   - Remove nickname from user creation/update logic
   - Update request validation schemas to exclude nickname
   - Remove nickname from any user serialization/response objects

3. **Database Migration:**
   - Create a Supabase migration file to drop the nickname column
   - Ensure proper rollback strategy in case migration needs to be reverted
   - Update any database constraints or indexes that reference the nickname column
   - Consider data backup if nickname data needs to be preserved

4. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Update API documentation to reflect removed nickname field
   - Update any user guides or registration flow documentation

5. **Code Cleanup:**
   - Remove any utility functions specifically for nickname handling
   - Clean up imports and dependencies related to nickname functionality

# Test Strategy:
Verification should include:

1. **Frontend Testing:**
   - Verify registration forms no longer display nickname input field
   - Test form submission works without nickname data
   - Confirm TypeScript compilation passes without nickname-related type errors
   - Test user profile displays correctly without nickname references

2. **Backend Testing:**
   - Test registration API endpoints reject requests containing nickname field
   - Verify user creation works without nickname parameter
   - Confirm API responses don't include nickname field
   - Test that existing users without nickname data function normally

3. **Database Testing:**
   - Run the migration in a test environment to ensure it executes successfully
   - Verify the nickname column is completely removed from the user table
   - Test that existing user records remain intact after column removal
   - Confirm application functionality works with updated database schema

4. **Integration Testing:**
   - End-to-end test of complete registration flow without nickname
   - Test user login and profile access for both new and existing users
   - Verify no broken references to nickname field throughout the application

5. **Rollback Testing:**
   - Test migration rollback functionality in development environment
   - Ensure application can handle both old and new schema during deployment
