# Cursor Rule — Friendly Update Report

## Purpose  
Make it obvious **what** the LLM just changed and **where**, but integrate the report into the normal response (no fenced code blocks).

## How to report changes  
1. **Place the report at the end of your reply**, after any other content you need to send.  
2. **Start the section with the heading:**  
3. **List each edited file on its own bullet line** in plain Markdown:  
- `<relative/path/to/file.ext>` — short, friendly description of what was changed  
- `<another/file>` — short, friendly description  

*(Do not wrap this section in triple back-ticks or any other code fencing.)*

## Example output (for guidance only)

Normal assistant response goes here… maybe an explanation of why the change was made.

### What I just tweaked
- `backend/app.ts` — reverted `dotenv` config to its default setup  
- `backend/server.ts` — moved `dotenv.config()` to the very top so it runs before everything else
