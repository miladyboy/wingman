## Problem Statement
Currently, the loading animation does not start immediately when a user sends a message. This results in a laggy or unresponsive user experience, as users do not receive instant feedback that their message (text or image) is being processed.

## Outcome / Goal
The loading animation should begin as soon as the user sends a messageâ€”whether it contains text, images, or both. This will provide immediate visual feedback and improve perceived performance for all message types.

## User Story
As a user sending a message (text, image, or both), I want to see a loading animation start instantly when I send my message, so that I know my action is being processed without delay.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Given I send a message (text, image, or both),
  - When I press send/submit,
  - Then the loading animation should appear immediately (optimistically), before any backend response.
- The loading animation should persist until the message (and any images) are fully processed and a response is received.
- If the message or upload fails, the animation should stop and an error message should be shown.
- The animation should not flicker or double-start if multiple messages are sent in quick succession.
- All existing tests for message sending and image upload should continue to pass.

## Impact Analysis
- Likely impacted files:
  - `frontend/src/components/` (chat input, image upload, loading animation)
  - Any state management for message/send status (e.g., context, Redux, Zustand, etc.)
  - Message and image send handler logic
- No backend or migration changes expected.
- No new environment variables required.

## Implementation Hints
- Use optimistic UI updates: set loading state as soon as the send action is dispatched, regardless of message type.
- Ensure loading state is decoupled from backend response timing.
- Consider edge cases: rapid multiple sends, send failures, and UI resets.

## Testing Requirements
- **Unit**: Test the send handler to ensure loading state is set immediately for both text and image messages.
- **Integration/E2E**: Simulate sending messages (text, image, both) and verify the animation appears instantly and persists until completion.
- **Non-functional**: Confirm no regressions in message or image send performance or UI responsiveness.

## Out-of-Scope
- Backend message or upload performance improvements.
- Changes to the actual animation design or style (unless required for bugfix).

## Risks & Mitigations
- Risk: Animation may not clear on error. Mitigation: Ensure error handling resets loading state.
- Risk: Multiple concurrent sends may cause race conditions. Mitigation: Test with rapid/multiple sends.

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Loading animation starts immediately on any message send action (text, image, or both).
- [ ] Animation persists until send completes or fails.
- [ ] Errors clear the animation and show a message.
- [ ] All relevant tests are updated or added.
- [ ] No regressions in chat or image upload flows.
