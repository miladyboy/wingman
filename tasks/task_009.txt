# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Optimistic Chat Deletion with Error Recovery
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement optimistic UI updates for chat deletion that instantly removes chats from the interface while handling backend failures gracefully by restoring chats if deletion fails.
# Details:
This task involves implementing optimistic UI patterns for chat deletion to improve perceived responsiveness:

1. **Frontend Chat Service Updates:**
   - Modify the chat service to support optimistic deletion patterns
   - Implement immediate UI state updates when delete is initiated
   - Add error recovery mechanisms to restore chats on backend failure
   - Update chat state management to handle pending deletion states
   - Implement rollback functionality for failed deletions

2. **UI Component Updates:**
   - Update chat list components to immediately hide deleted chats
   - Add visual indicators for chats in pending deletion state (optional)
   - Implement smooth animations for chat removal and restoration
   - Update delete confirmation dialogs to reflect optimistic behavior
   - Ensure proper keyboard navigation after optimistic deletions

3. **Error Handling Implementation:**
   - Create robust error handling for failed backend deletions
   - Implement user-friendly error messages when deletion fails
   - Add retry mechanisms for transient network failures
   - Ensure proper state restoration on various error scenarios
   - Log deletion failures for monitoring and debugging

4. **State Management Updates:**
   - Update Redux/Zustand stores to handle optimistic deletion states
   - Implement proper state synchronization between UI and backend
   - Add pending deletion tracking to prevent duplicate operations
   - Ensure consistent state across multiple chat components
   - Handle edge cases like rapid successive deletions

5. **Backend Integration:**
   - Ensure backend deletion endpoints return appropriate error codes
   - Implement proper error response handling in API layer
   - Add request deduplication to prevent multiple deletion attempts
   - Update API client to handle optimistic deletion patterns

# Test Strategy:
**Unit Tests:**
- Test chat service optimistic deletion methods with mocked backend responses
- Verify error recovery mechanisms restore chats correctly on failure
- Test state management updates for various deletion scenarios
- Validate UI component behavior during optimistic deletions and rollbacks
- Test edge cases like rapid successive deletions and network failures

**Integration Tests:**
- Test complete deletion flow from UI trigger to backend confirmation
- Verify proper error handling when backend deletion fails
- Test state synchronization between multiple chat components
- Validate API error response handling and retry mechanisms

**E2E Tests:**
- Create test that verifies chat disappears immediately on delete action
- Test error scenario where backend deletion fails and chat is restored
- Verify user can continue using the interface normally after failed deletion
- Test multiple chat deletions in sequence with mixed success/failure outcomes
- Validate proper error messages are displayed to users on deletion failures
- Ensure all animations and transitions work smoothly during optimistic operations
